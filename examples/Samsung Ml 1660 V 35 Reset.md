If you own a Samsung ML-1660 or ML-1665 printer, you may encounter a problem where the red light on the printer starts blinking or stays on. This means that the printer has reached its page limit and needs to be reset. Resetting the printer will allow you to print more pages with the same toner cartridge. However, resetting the printer also voids your warranty and may damage your printer. Therefore, you should only do this at your own risk and after reading this tutorial carefully.
 
Before you start, you need to find out the version of your printer. You can do this by printing a configuration page or by removing the right cover of your printer and looking at the chip on the toner cartridge. The version number is usually in the format of vXX.XX.XX.XX, where XX are digits. For example, v1.20.00.30 or v0.82.00.78.

8. Click Start Download and wait for the process to finish.
9. The red light on your printer should stop blinking or turn off.
10. Turn off your printer and remove the tape from the toner cartridge.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset your Samsung ML-1660/ML-1665 printer. However, keep in mind that this is not a permanent solution and you may need to repeat this process again in the future. Also, be aware that resetting your printer may affect its performance and quality. If you encounter any problems with your printer, you may need to contact Samsung support or buy a new toner cartridge.
  
If you are wondering why your printer needs to be reset, here is the explanation. Each toner cartridge for the Samsung ML-1660/ML-1665 printer has a memory chip that records the toner usage. Depending on whether it is a starter cartridge or a replacement cartridge, the printer will only allow you to print up to a certain number of pages. When the red light starts blinking, the printer is warning you that it is time to get a new cartridge and you will still be able to print some more pages. Once the red light turns solid, you will not be able to print anymore pages, even if you know you still have toner left in the cartridge.
 
By resetting the printer, you are tricking the printer into thinking that you have installed a new toner cartridge. This way, you can use up all the toner in your current cartridge and save money. However, this also means that you will not get any warning when your toner is running low. You will have to check the print quality regularly and replace the toner cartridge when it becomes too faint or streaky.
 
Resetting your printer also has some risks and drawbacks. First of all, you are violating the terms and conditions of your warranty and Samsung may refuse to service your printer if they find out that you have reset it. Secondly, you may damage your printer or cause it to malfunction by using an incompatible firmware file or by interrupting the reset process. Thirdly, you may reduce the print quality and performance of your printer by using an old or low-quality toner cartridge. Finally, you may harm the environment by generating more waste and carbon emissions from your printer.
