Rice is a staple food for many Filipinos, but do you know how it came to be? According to a legend from the Nabaloi people, one of the indigenous groups in the Cordillera region, rice was a gift from Kabunian, the creator god, to a priest named Labangan who visited him in the Skyworld.
 
Labangan was curious about the rice that Kabunian and his wife ate, and wanted to bring some seeds to Earth. Kabunian agreed, but gave him specific instructions on how to plant and harvest the rice, as well as how to perform a ritual called kosday kanyaw to honor him. Labangan promised to follow the instructions, but he forgot to do the ritual when he returned to Earth. As a punishment, Kabunian created rats to eat the rice. Labangan regretted his mistake, so Kabunian created cats to chase away the rats. Ever since then, the Nabaloi people have been performing kosday kanyaw before harvest season to thank Kabunian for the rice.

Rice cultivation in the Philippines is important not only for food security, but also for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and workers. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, rice farming employed about 2.5 million people in 2018, or 16% of the total agricultural labor force. [7] Rice farming also contributes to the country's gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and rural development. [8]
 
However, rice cultivation in the Philippines also faces many challenges, such as climate change, pests and diseases, soil degradation, water scarcity, and market fluctuations. To cope with these challenges, rice farmers need access to improved technologies and innovations that can enhance their productivity, profitability, and resilience. One of these technologies is Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variety that contains beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. Golden Rice was developed to address vitamin A deficiency (VAD), a serious public health problem that affects millions of children and pregnant women in the Philippines and other developing countries. [9]
 
Golden Rice has been undergoing field trials and regulatory processes in the Philippines since 2009. It is expected to be approved for commercialization soon, pending the completion of biosafety assessments and public consultations. [10] However, the adoption of Golden Rice by Filipino farmers and consumers is not guaranteed, as it depends on various factors such as awareness, preferences, costs, benefits, risks, and social norms. A study by Stone et al. (2020) explored the factors that influence seed choice among rice farmers in Nueva Ecija, a major rice-producing province in Central Luzon. [11] The study used a technology adoption theory framework to analyze how farmers' perceptions of Golden Rice and other rice varieties affect their willingness to adopt them.
 
The study found that farmers' seed choice was influenced by four main factors: yield potential, grain quality, pest resistance, and input requirements. Farmers preferred varieties that had high yield potential, good grain quality (such as aroma, taste, and appearance), resistance to pests (such as insects and diseases), and low input requirements (such as fertilizer and water). The study also found that farmers' awareness of Golden Rice was low, and their perceptions of its benefits and risks were mixed. Some farmers were interested in Golden Rice because of its potential to improve health and income, while others were skeptical or indifferent because of its unfamiliarity, perceived inferiority, or ethical concerns.
 
The study concluded that Golden Rice adoption would depend on how well it performs compared to other available varieties in terms of yield potential, grain quality, pest resistance, and input requirements. The study also suggested that Golden Rice adoption could be enhanced by providing farmers with accurate information about its benefits and risks, involving them in participatory testing and evaluation, addressing their preferences and concerns, and ensuring its availability and affordability.
