The SignalKing SK-10TN is a powerful USB WiFi antenna that can boost your wireless signal and range. It is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems. However, you may need to download and install the driver manually if your system does not recognize it automatically. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## Step 1: Identify the Chipset of Your Antenna
 
The first thing you need to do is to identify the chipset of your antenna. The chipset is the main component that controls the wireless communication between your antenna and your computer. Different chipsets may require different drivers. The SignalKing SK-10TN antenna uses the Ralink RT3070 chipset, which is a common and widely supported chipset for wireless devices. You can confirm this by looking at the label on the back of your antenna or by checking the product specifications on the official website[^1^].
