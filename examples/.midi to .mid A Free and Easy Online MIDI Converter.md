# How to Convert MIDI Files to MID Files
 
MIDI files are a common format for storing and playing music data on computers and electronic devices. MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, and it is a technical standard that describes how musical notes, instruments, and other parameters are encoded and transmitted. MIDI files do not contain actual audio data, but rather instructions for how to produce the sound.

MID files are simply another extension for MIDI files. They are exactly the same in terms of content and structure, and they can be used interchangeably. There is no need to convert MIDI files to MID files, as they are already compatible with most programs and devices that support MIDI. However, some users may prefer to use the MID extension for consistency or compatibility reasons.
 
There are several ways to convert MIDI files to MID files, depending on your preferences and needs. Here are some of the most common methods:
 
- **Rename the file extension**: The easiest way to convert MIDI files to MID files is to simply rename the file extension from .midi to .mid. You can do this by right-clicking on the file name, selecting Rename, and changing the extension. Alternatively, you can use a batch renaming tool to rename multiple files at once.
- **Re-save the file with a different extension**: Another way to convert MIDI files to MID files is to re-save the file with a different extension using a program that supports MIDI. For example, you can use a music notation software like MuseScore[^2^] or Sibelius[^2^], a music editing software like WavePad[^2^] or Awave Studio[^2^], or a guitar tablature software like Guitar Pro[^2^] or TablEdit[^2^]. Simply open the MIDI file in the program, and choose Save As or Export, and select MID as the output format.
- **Use an online converter**: A third way to convert MIDI files to MID files is to use an online converter service that can handle MIDI formats. For example, you can use Zamzar[^3^], ConvertHelper[^1^], or MConverter[^4^] to upload your MIDI file and download it as a MID file. This method is convenient if you don't have any software installed on your computer, but it may have some limitations in terms of file size, quality, and security.

As you can see, converting MIDI files to MID files is not a difficult task, as they are essentially the same format with different extensions. You can choose the method that suits your needs and preferences best, and enjoy your music files in any way you like.
  
In addition to converting MIDI files to MID files, you may also want to convert them to other audio formats that can store actual sound data. For example, you may want to convert MIDI files to MP3, WAV, or FLAC files, which are more widely supported and can be played on any device. However, keep in mind that converting MIDI files to audio files will result in some loss of quality and information, as the original MIDI instructions will be replaced by a fixed audio recording.
 
To convert MIDI files to audio files, you will need a software that can render the MIDI data into sound using a soundfont or a synthesizer. A soundfont is a collection of samples of different instruments that can be used to reproduce the MIDI notes. A synthesizer is a device or a program that can generate sound from various parameters and effects. Depending on the quality and type of the soundfont or synthesizer, the resulting audio file may sound more or less realistic and accurate.
 
Some of the programs that can convert MIDI files to audio files are:

- **Audacity**: Audacity is a free and open-source audio editing software that can import and export MIDI files. To convert MIDI files to audio files with Audacity, you will need to install a soundfont file and select it as the MIDI playback device in the preferences. Then, you can open the MIDI file in Audacity, and choose Export as MP3, WAV, or any other format you want.
- **FL Studio**: FL Studio is a professional music production software that can create and edit MIDI files. To convert MIDI files to audio files with FL Studio, you will need to load the MIDI file into the playlist or the piano roll, and assign it to a channel with a soundfont or a synthesizer plugin. Then, you can choose File > Export > MP3 file or WAV file, and adjust the settings as you wish.
- **Online converter**: As mentioned before, you can also use an online converter service that can handle MIDI formats. However, not all online converters can convert MIDI files to audio files, and some of them may have limited options for choosing the soundfont or the synthesizer. For example, Zamzar can only convert MIDI files to MP3 files with a default soundfont, while ConvertHelper and MConverter can convert MIDI files to various audio formats with different soundfont options.

Converting MIDI files to audio files can be useful if you want to share your music with others or play it on any device. However, remember that MIDI files are more flexible and versatile than audio files, as they can be modified and customized in many ways. Therefore, it is always a good idea to keep a backup of your original MIDI files before converting them.
