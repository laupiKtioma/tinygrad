## What are some tips and tricks for playing Diablo 3 on console?
 
Diablo 3 on console is a fun and addictive game that can keep you hooked for hours. However, it can also be challenging and frustrating at times, especially if you are new to the game or playing on higher difficulties. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you survive and thrive in Sanctuary:

- Choose a class that suits your playstyle and preferences. There are seven classes in Diablo 3: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor, and Wizard. Each class has its own strengths, weaknesses, skills, and equipment. Experiment with different classes and find out which one you enjoy the most.
- Customize your skills and runes according to your needs and situation. You can change your skills and runes at any time outside of combat. You can also use Elective Mode to assign any skill to any button. Try different combinations of skills and runes and see what works best for you.
- Upgrade your gear regularly and look for items that enhance your stats and abilities. You can find gear by killing enemies, opening chests, completing quests, or buying from vendors. You can also craft gear using materials and recipes from the blacksmith or jeweler. Look for items that have high damage, defense, critical chance, critical damage, attack speed, life per hit, life per kill, elemental damage, or other bonuses that suit your class.
- Use gems to boost your gear even further. Gems are special items that can be socketed into certain gear slots to provide additional benefits. You can find gems by looting enemies or chests, or by buying from vendors. You can also combine lower quality gems into higher quality ones using the jeweler. Gems come in different colors and types, each with its own effect. For example, red gems increase damage, blue gems increase intelligence, green gems increase critical damage, etc.
- Use health potions and healing wells to restore your health when needed. Health potions are consumable items that heal you instantly when used. You can carry up to 100 health potions at a time, and they have a cooldown of 30 seconds before you can use another one. Healing wells are stationary objects that heal you over time when activated. They have a limited amount of charges before they run out.
- Use shrines and pools of reflection to gain temporary buffs or permanent experience bonuses. Shrines are glowing objects that grant you a random buff when touched. The buff lasts for two minutes and can affect your damage, defense, speed, resource regeneration, or experience gain. Pools of reflection are blue pools that grant you a permanent bonus to your experience gain 8cf37b1e13
