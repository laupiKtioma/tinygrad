You need to pay attention to these factors to drive safely and efficiently.
  
The Railworks 4 HRQ Siemens Taurus ES64U4 pack is not only a locomotive pack, but also a learning tool. You can learn a lot about the Taurus and its systems by reading the manuals and tutorials that are included in the pack. You can also test your skills and knowledge by completing the scenarios that are designed to challenge you in different situations. You can learn how to start and stop the locomotive, how to use the AFB and LZB systems, how to deal with emergencies and more.
